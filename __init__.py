"""H3 Motion Context.

Clip chaining for MiniMax H3: pin the tail of the previous clip, picture
and sound, so the next clip genuinely continues it.

This registers the nodes and nothing else. Nothing in ComfyUI is
modified. Earlier versions wrapped ComfyUI's H3 layout constructor to
lift a restriction on where a keyframe could be anchored; ComfyUI 0.34.0
lifted it upstream, so the nodes now build plain keyframe dicts and hand
them to stock code.

What remains is a dependency on meaning rather than structure: the pinned
audio window is placed with a fractional, negative anchor index, which is
legal arithmetic in the layout but is not reachable through any stock
node and therefore has no upstream test. layout_contract.py checks it
before the first render and refuses if it ever stops holding, so an
upstream change produces a clear error rather than a silently wrong join.

That check runs on first use, not at import, so having the pack installed
changes nothing until you actually chain a clip.

Requires ComfyUI 0.34.0 or newer. Pack version 0.3.1 is the last release
that works with 0.33.4 and older.
